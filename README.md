# Landing-page

This is the most complete and most interesting assignment i've cam across so far in my
journey as a web developer. And i'm super excited about it.

The project as it says on title is a Landing page, Where i'll be applying almost all that i learned in this past week. which are-

- Html
- Css
- Flexbox

Hope it turns out alright!
